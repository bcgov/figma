### How to Contribute

If you have new patterns/components to contribute that you think should be considered to be made 'official' in the Design System:

1. Ensure you're building on the [latest version](https://github.com/bcgov/figma/blob/master/versions/bcgov_2020-06-15.fig?raw=true)
2. Share your Figma file with Mark.Wilson@gov.bc.ca and Inderdeep.Singh@gov.bc.ca and send us an email detailing the new elements you've created.

For patterns that aren't yet defined in the [Design System](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Design-System/About-the-Design-System), we'll consult with Davis.Levine@gov.bc.ca.

If your pattern is accepted, we'll add it to the master and release a new version.
