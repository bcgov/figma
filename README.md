This repository was the beginning of an effort to build a Figma template for use across BC Gov.

## Project Status

![Lifecycle:Retired](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Retired-d45500)

GDX are currently working on a new build of the B.C. Design System. The new design system will include a Figma library containing design tokens and components. These new assets will be published to the [Design System repo](https://github.com/bcgov/design-system/) ðŸ‘€ and on Figma in early 2024. If you have questions about the new design system, email DesignSystem@gov.bc.ca.
